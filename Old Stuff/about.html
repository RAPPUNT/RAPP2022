      <p>The Research and Project Portal is a website that has a list of research and projects that are either active or completed by Loyola students and faculty. The primary goal of this website is to have a resource that allows students to connect with opportunities for independent projects or research within the computer science department.</p>
      <p>The first benefit is the ability for professors and students to spread awareness of what they are currently working on (without a constant active effort.) The second benefit is that projects can be registered while the idea is still in the formulation phase. Students could collaborate with the professor to come up with a final idea that best suits both parties. The third benefit is that if a student has an area of study they are interested in, they can search to see which professors are doing work in that area and might be best suited to advise them.</p>
